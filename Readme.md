# Game: El Trilero De Las Ramblas

- El Trilero ("shell-game artist, or "Thimble-rig") is a typical Scam in las Ramblas de Barcelona for every tourist to enjoy, but sadly just until now.
- The changes in social environments due to COVID-19 issues, have put and end to this traditional practice of subsidiary cosmic justice.
- This application is intended to give visitors a grasp of the experience of being ripped off by a 'trilero'.

- First of all, this is a watered-down version of this experience, because an important part of the thrill is being surrounded by menacing men playing their role, and the effort of the artists is it, to build up momentum on your nerves. And this, as the reader can most definetly understand, is not so easy to replicate on a web page app.
